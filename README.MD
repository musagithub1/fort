# Fort - E-Commerce Store Prompts

## 🎨 Prompt 1: Image Generation

```
Create a complete set of images for an online store brand (Mussa's Store). 
I need the following visuals:

1. A clean hero banner for the homepage with a modern minimalistic background.

2. A set of 4 product photos in the same style and lighting.

3. A lifestyle image showing the products in real-world use.

4. A brand logo in a simple, bold, and memorable style.

5. A background texture that can be used for website sections.

Make all images consistent in style, color palette, lighting, and mood. 
Use a professional ecommerce look, high resolution, and clean composition.

Save all images in folder "Img" with a consistent visual identity so I can 
use them on my online store.
```

## 💻 Prompt 2: Website Creation

```
Use the images in "Img" directory I generated earlier for my store and now 
build a complete ecommerce website for my online store (Mussa's Store).
Work inside a single main project folder.

Here is what I want you to create:

1. Use all the images I generated earlier. Place them in the images folder 
   and import them correctly into the website.

2. Create the following pages in HTML and CSS:
   • Homepage with hero banner, featured products, trust badges, and call to action
   • Product catalog page that loads product cards using my images
   • Product detail template with gallery, price, description, and add to cart button
   • Shopping cart page with summary layout
   • Checkout layout placeholder
   • About page with brand story
   • Contact page with email form and general info
   • A global header and footer included on every page

3. Style the site using a modern professional ecommerce look. Use a color 
   palette that matches the images I provided. Make the layout mobile-friendly 
   and fast.

4. Create a main JavaScript file for:
   • Product card interactions
   • Image gallery switching
   • A working cart system stored in local storage
   • Smooth scrolling and simple animations

5. Write clean placeholder text that I can replace later. Keep the tone 
   friendly and confident.

6. Make sure the homepage hero banner uses one of the images I generated. 
   Use consistent branding throughout the entire website.

7. After building all files, show me a file tree of what you created. 
   Then ask me if I want to:
   • Add products
   • Connect a real payment system
   • Turn the store into a full framework like React or Next
   • Publish the website online

Follow each step carefully.
